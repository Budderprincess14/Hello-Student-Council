        <h1>Hello Student Council!</h1>
            <p>I wanted to make this for yall to say how excited I am for this school year. Unfortunately, this is my last year here, so I want to make it count. I'm gonna ask Mrs. Velie if I can share this next meeting. The font is called Kufam, and if any of you are tech savvy, I left the link to my GitHub repo for you to look at, just click the button. I love yall and let's make this year one of the best yet!</p>
